        <h1>BETELHEM SOLOMON</h1>
        <p>My name is Betelhem Solomon. I am a software engineer second year student at AASTU.<br>
            well ,let's be honest, you dont want to hear where i was born and raised ,so i will skip that part.let me just<br>
            tell you how i end up in software engineering. Back when i was in highschool and elementary, honestly i didn't <br>
            have any interest in software and computer engineering but i knew i was not good at memorizing subject like <br>
            biology so medicine was not even an option. same goes to social studies ,so i join natural science and suddenly <br>
            end up in engineering department . we all know how the engineering deparment name is so ruined, yet what i<br> 
            found here was quite different .Everyone seems intelligent and has some skill, whether it is drawing,singing or<br>
            anything everyone seems so intersting ...back to how i choose software engineering, then i listed  all the <br>
            department i knew, googled their job opportunities ,salary,and  most of all ,what kind of things i will <br>
            encounter in the learning journey. Then i end up with 2 choices: software engineering and computer science and<br>
            as you know aastu only offers software engineering so i ended up here.
